# Summary:
"""India's real estate sector is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.7 per cent from 2020 to 2030. The sector's trajectory from USD180 billion in 2020 to an estimated market size of USD1 trillion by 2030 is underpinned by government-led initiatives. The integration of technology has revolutionised the sector, from smart homes to data-driven insights. While challenges exist, India stands poised to navigate these by capitalising on opportunities and leveraging the momentum. The report intends to catalyse informed dialogue, fostering a deeper understanding of the opportunities and transformative trends shaping the sector. India ranked #3 for the number of LEED -certified green buildings in 2022. The flexible office space stock in India is expected to cross 80 million sq. ft. by the end of 2025. Data centres, healthcare, hospitality, co-living and co-working spaces are expected to drive investments. The real estate sector contributes 7.3 per cent to India’s GDP, which is expected to reach 13 per cent by 2025. The sector's projected value of USD1,000 billion by 2030 underscores its crucial role in the country's economic growth. It plays a pivotal role in job creation, government revenue and the growth of interconnected industries. The real estate sector is broadly categorised into residential, commercial and mixed -use segments. The government has introduced various policies and reforms to support the growth. Infrastructure development projects such as the Smart Cities Mission and the development of industrial corridors are driving real estate growth. More than 60 per cent of the total residential units launched in the first three quarters of CY2023 came from Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad. Luxury segment (costing more than USD0.4 million) saw an 83 per cent rise y - o-y with 14,627 units sold in 9M20236. The residential segment is likely to continue with focus on the launch of diversified projects including plotted developments, low-rise apartments, row houses and villaments. Demand for office spaces and leased retail spaces are largely driving the commercial real estate uptake in Delhi NCR. The real estate sector in India has witnessed a surge in investments in recent years, driven by factors such as a growing population, urbanisation and government initiatives. This trend is expected to continue, in line with the government's focus on affordable housing, infrastructure development and easing of regulatory barriers. Both domestic and foreign investors are increasingly showing interest in the Indian real estate market. Investments are poised to reach USD59.7 billion by 204713, indicating considerable potential for ongoing growth and development in the sector. Capital appreciation and high rental yields are driving investments in the real estate sector. Sub-segments such as data centres, healthcare, hospitality, co -living and co -working spaces are expected to drive PE investments. The Smart Cities Mission is a significant opportunity for real estate developers, as it aims to establish 100 smart cities across India. The flexible space stock in India is expected to cross 80 million sq. ft. by the end of 2025. Tier II and III cities are recognised as smart investments within the sector, driven by talent availability and affordability. India's economy is expected to continue growing at a rapid pace, with a GDP growth rate of around 6-7.1 per cent in the coming years. Sustainability is a growing trend towards sustainability in the real estate sector, with increasing demand for green buildings and sustainable practices. The relationship between technology and real estate in India is poised to propel the sector. Adoption of technology promotes energy - efficient practices in buildings, aligning with India's focus on sustainable development. Digital platforms showcase residential and commercial properties in diverse locations, fostering inclusivity and attracting interest from investors/buyers. Proptech start -ups raised USD2.4 billion in funds between January 2021 and March 2023. Integration of technology across the real estate value chain provides multifaceted benefits to developers and occupiers. The sector is undergoing a digital transformation, with technology playing an increasingly significant role in every stage of the value chain. From property search and marketing to transaction and management, the integration of technology is transforming the way properties are bought, sold and managed. Sustainability has become a top priority for the real estate sector worldwide. Adoption of renewable sources, waste reduction measures and retrofitting of buildings are accelerators of sustainability. 82 per cent of Grade A new office supply as of September 2023 is green certified. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems consume over 50 per cent of the energy used in buildings. Retrofitting measures such as chiller sequencing, using low -approach cooling towers, installing variable frequency drives and auto tube cooling systems can be implemented. India awarded LEED certification to a total of 323 projects in 2022, covering 10.5+ million gross square meters. The Surat Diamond Bourse (SDB) building inaugurated in 2023 is the world’s largest office complex with over 67 lakh square feet of floor area. Denmark Launched a subsidy scheme for improving energy efficiency in public buildings. Greece Through the Electra scheme, public buildings are encouraged to adopt energy -efficient technologies. Spain Upgrading public administration offices by implementing energy - efficient and renewable energy systems in buildings. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) provide high appreciation potential, easy tracking and diversification benefits. The market size in India was USD5.4 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach USD8.9 billion by 2025. The demand for fractional ownership is expected to continue to grow. India's real estate sector is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48 per cent between 2020 and 202332. Investments are expected to reach USD5 billion by 202532. The growth trajectory of India’s real estate is surrounded by a set of challenges that demand mitigation strategies.
